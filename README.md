### Known Photopea limitations:
  - Photoshop constants and constructors that don't work:
      - UnitValue (need to write metrics like layer width and height)
      - TextType
  - Can't assign anonymous functions to variables
  - It's Javascript but not ES6+
  - Can't use undeclared variables (in JS they're undefined by default)
  - Can't do conditionals against undeclared variables
